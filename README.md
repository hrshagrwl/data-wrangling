##Project: Data Wrangling using Pandas and Regex
In this project you are asked to implement and perform a unit testing for a series of Python functions (Q1-Q13) that are typically required during the data wrangling phase of the end-to-end data science pipeline. A subset of unit testing functions is provided for you. You are expected to write unit testing for all the remaining functions.

Data Wrangling consists of the following main steps:

Data Acquisition
Data Cleansing
Data Understanding: Basics
Data Manipulation

1. Data Acquisition Objectives

Question 1: How to import multiples files for storage and access? (store filenames in array)
Question 2: How to import data in different formats? (read_excel, read_csv)
Question 2: How are they read into by pandas? (DataFrame)
Question 4: How to have a peek at the data after import? (head/tail)
2. Data Cleansing Objectives

Question 5: Check attributes of each file
Question 5: Identify data types
Question 5: Apply coercion if applicable
Question 5: Check for NA/missing data
Question 6: Remove/replace corrupt data
Question 6: Identify duplicate data
Question 6: Check for corrupt/incorrect data

Check for data consistency (e.g. GPA cannot be less than 0)

Identifying and removing outliers
3. Data Understanding Objectives

Question 7: Basic Summary Statistics
Question 9: Dimensionality
4. Data Manipulation Objectives

Question 11: Merge/Concatenate DataFrame
Question 11: Mapping to create a new attribute
Question 11: Incorporate the use of multiple functions
Question 12: Filter to subset the data
