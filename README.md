## Project: Data Wrangling using Pandas and Regex

In this project you are asked __to implement__ and __perform a unit testing__ for a series of Python functions (Q1-Q13) that are typically required during the ***data wrangling*** phase of the end-to-end data science pipeline. A subset of unit testing functions is provided for you. You are expected to write unit testing for all the remaining functions.

__Data Wrangling consists of the following main steps:__

* Data Acquisition
* Data Cleansing
* Data Understanding: Basics
* Data Manipulation
  
  
__1. Data Acquisition Objectives__

* Question 1: How to import multiples files for storage and access? (store filenames in array)
* Question 2: How to import data in different formats? (read_excel, read_csv)
* Question 2: How are they read into by pandas? (DataFrame)
* Question 4: How to have a peek at the data after import? (head/tail)

__2. Data Cleansing Objectives__

* Question 5: Check attributes of each file
* Question 5: Identify data types
* Question 5: Apply coercion if applicable
* Question 5: Check for NA/missing data
* Question 6: Remove/replace corrupt data
* Question 6: Identify duplicate data
* Question 6: Check for corrupt/incorrect data  

* Check for data consistency (e.g. GPA cannot be less than 0)
* Identifying and removing outliers

__3. Data Understanding Objectives__

* Question 7: Basic Summary Statistics
* Question 9: Dimensionality

__4. Data Manipulation Objectives__

* Question 11: Merge/Concatenate DataFrame
* Question 11: Mapping to create a new attribute
* Question 11: Incorporate the use of multiple functions
* Question 12: Filter to subset the data
* Question 13: Discretize data 
  
  
__Regular Expressions:__ *Regular expressions are used in conjunction with other preprocessing steps for matching/parsing patterns.*

* Questions 2/5/6: Filter to subset the dataUse regular expressions to find/match specific content
* Question 6: Filter to subset the dataString manipulation via. substring and replace methods
